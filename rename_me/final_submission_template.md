> Give a brief description of the final product:
    a canvas feature that analyzes student navigation data to create recommended groups of users with similar navigation habits, which ideally translates to similar motivations and goals

# Reflection
## Approach
> What was your approach to the dataset? What problem did you want to solve? What technology did you decide to use? How did your team split the work?
    - tidied the data first to see which data could be the most useable based on given data
    - wanted to solve the issue of finding people to collaborate with
    - we used R to tidy, sort through, and analyze data as well as create graphs and tables
    - we split up work based on each teammate's strengths and weaknesses

## Wins / Challenges
> Describe some wins / challenges. What did you learn? What would you do differently next time?
    wins: collaborating to brainstorm ideas and a new feature
    challenges: coming up with an idea based on the limited/imperfect data

    learned about the information canvas has on each user as well as more about analyzing data in the real world

    next time, we would spend more time looking at data specifically to figure out what to work with
