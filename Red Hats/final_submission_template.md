> Give a brief description of the final product:
- We have created a regression to predict the final grade of a student based on the Total Discussion Character Length.

# Reflection
## Approach
> What was your approach to the dataset? What problem did you want to solve? What technology did you decide to use? How did your team split the work?
- We started with cleaning the dataset and plot some of the features to get some insightes on the data. 
- We wanted to predict the study time needed for a student to achieve a certain degree based on time spent and engagment on Canvas. 
- We have used python and few useful liberaries like pandas, matplotlib, ...etc. also we have used Git and GitHub to facilitate the teamwork. 
- We split the work in four different ways. some members worked on cleaning, others on data visulaizations, and others on brain storming ideas.  


## Wins / Challenges
> Describe some wins / challenges. What did you learn? What would you do differently next time?
- We have learned new skills in data visualization and Git and GitGub control. defentely, trying to get insights from the data was the most challanging part. 
For next time, we would spend more time on data cleaning and merging datasets. also, we would make more plots to make the data clearer.
