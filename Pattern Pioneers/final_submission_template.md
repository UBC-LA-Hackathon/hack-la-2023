> Give a brief description of the final product: 
The final product is a dynamic Tableau dashboard that not only displays learner discussion engagement trends but also integrates correlation metrics and timelines of assignment submissions. This enables a multifaceted view of student activity, correlating discussion participation with actual assignment completion, providing educators with insights to optimize teaching strategies and deadlines.

# Reflection
## Approach
> What was your approach to the dataset? What problem did you want to solve? What technology did you decide to use? How did your team split the work?
We tackled the dataset with a focus on identifying learner engagement patterns, using Python for data analysis. The team was split between data preparation and in-depth analysis tasks.


## Wins / Challenges
> Describe some wins / challenges. What did you learn? What would you do differently next time?
Our win was revealing engagement trends, which was challenging due to time-zone conversions and complex data interpretation. Lessons learned include the value of thorough initial data exploration.
